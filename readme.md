## weird-fe

A very experimental attempt to write my own frontend for akkoma(/anything else supporting the mastodon api)

Made mostly to experiment with whatever ideas I found interesting, which is why the frontend is served as a completely static site, and heavily uses web components

Supports:

-   Viewing posts (with attatchments, content warnings, etc)
-   Viewing replies to a post in a threaded view
-   Viewing a user's posts
-   Viewing an instance's federated timeline
-   Emoji reactions
-   Quote posts
-   Akkoma's subset of MFM
